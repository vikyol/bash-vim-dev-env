# CloudShell Development Environment

These configurations are created to be used in AWS CloudShell environment.

It is quite common to assume roles for privileged accounts from another account. 
That is why enabling these configurations will highlight the assume role credentials in the bash prompt.
If `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable is set, the configuration will update the prompt 
to display the current account name and the assumed role name.

```
cloudshell-user@ip-10-4-0-1:~/git [ACCOUNT_NAME:ROLE_NAME]$
```

## Usage

Copy the configuration file to your home folder. 
Source the `.bashrc` file to apply the configurations. 

```bash
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.1
cp .bashrc .bash_utils .bash_aliases .vimrc ~
source ~/.bashrc
```
